Matrix inversion is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, allowing for the solution of systems of linear equations, transformation of coordinates, and solving various mathematical and engineering problems. In essence, the inverse of a matrix undoes the action of the original matrix, similar to how division undoes multiplication.
